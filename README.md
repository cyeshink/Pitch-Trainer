# Pitch-Trainer

Pitch Trainer is an android application that is designed to help users identify pitch correctly and in the end, help develop perfect pitch.

There are three modes.

1) Perfect Pitch Training

  This is the general training tool with no limitations. There is a hint button which gives you the pitch for middle C. Otherwise, you can keep going at it until you feel comfortable or you are done for the day.
  
2) Perfect Pitch Ladder

  This is more of a game mode to see how many pitches you can identify correctly in a row. You keep going until you mess up and the app will display number of consecutive correct answers.
  
3) Perfect Pitch Test

  This is also like a game mode which helps you to see how accurate your pitch identifying skills are. 30 pitches are given to be identified and at the end, the number of correct answers along with your accuracy rate will be shown.
  
Alternate Uses:
  If you need to know a certain pitch, you can press on the pitch and it will play it out to you. This is good for when you need the starting note during a performance and etc.
  Also, it could possibly help you tune your instrument.
